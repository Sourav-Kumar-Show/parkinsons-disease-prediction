# Parkinson’s Disease Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech.
Early detection can help in better treatment and management of the disease.

This project focuses on analyzing clinical data and building machine learning models to predict whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on various biomedical voice measurements.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains multiple biomedical voice measurements collected from individuals
- Each record is labeled as Parkinson’s or non-Parkinson’s
- Dataset includes features such as frequency measures, amplitude variations, and noise ratios

*(Dataset source can be added here if publicly available)*

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The following data preprocessing steps were performed:
- Checked for missing values
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Scaled numerical features where required
- Verified class distribution

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand patterns and relationships in the data:
- Distribution analysis of important features
- Correlation analysis to identify highly related variables
- Visualization of feature importance trends

Key observations were derived to guide model selection and feature engineering.
